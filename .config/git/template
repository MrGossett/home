# Why is this change necessary?
# 
# This question tells reviewers of your pull request what to expect in
# the commit, allowing them to more easily identify and point out
# unrelated changes.


# How does it address the issue?
# 
# Describe, at a high level, what was done to affect change. Introduce a
# red/black tree to increase search speed or Remove <troublesome gem X>,
# which was causing <specific description of issue introduced by gem> are
# good examples.
# 
# If your change is obvious, you may be able to omit addressing this question.

# What side effects does this change have?
# 
# This is the most important question to answer, as it can point out
# problems where you are making too many changes in one commit or branch.
# One or two bullet points for related changes may be okay, but five or
# six are likely indicators of a commit that is doing too many things.
# 
# Your team should have guidelines and rules-of-thumb for how much can
# be done in a single commit/branch.
